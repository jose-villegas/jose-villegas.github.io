This technique is well explained here in &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/all/modules/custom/gpugems/books/GPUGems/gpugems_ch01.html&#34;&gt;GPU GEMS&lt;/a&gt;. My twist was just using flat shading. The reposity was well received in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jose-villegas/LowPolyWater&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first Global Game Jam, though I had been to game jams before in college. This was a really great experience that ended up with me going for four years consecutively. The idea of making a complete game in just 48 hours was first daunting, but later awesome and completely achievable with good team work and focus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
