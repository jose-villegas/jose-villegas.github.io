      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tile&amp;rsquo;s Waltz is a game I started developing alone during quarantine for the COVID-19 crisis. It&amp;rsquo;s a puzzle game with a focus on memorization, you remove pieces from the level, when that piece is removed other pieces move to take their place, using this mechanic you need to combine 3 or more pieces of the same color to get combos or powerful power ups. The game still in-development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do a small tests with shaders in Unity to simulate water using sum of sines. This technique is well explained here in &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/all/modules/custom/gpugems/books/GPUGems/gpugems_ch01.html&#34;&gt;GPU GEMS&lt;/a&gt;. My twist was just using flat shading. The reposity was well received in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jose-villegas/LowPolyWater&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was still in college this was my first experience profesionally as a game developer. Living in Caracas at the time I got contacted by a startup called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.learnsafari.com/&#34;&gt;LearnSafari&lt;/a&gt;, this happened in my last year of college, thanks to the game jams. Spanish Safari is a game or a tool for parents, with the purpose of teaching Spanish to kids in an interactive adventure game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
