      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first Global Game Jam, though I had been to game jams before in college. This was a really great experience that ended up with me going for four years consecutively. The idea of making a complete game in just 48 hours was first daunting, but later awesome and completely achievable with good team work and focus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this game jam we went with a more spooky game. And we wanted to make it multi-player. So we came up with the idea to make a tag game but with some modifications to fit the theme and make it more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time we really wanted to do a co-op game. We built the idea around a platform game where you play with your friend, you both co-perate together to advance in the map and defeat enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
