      <description>&lt;p&gt;I moved to Chile to work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamaga.com/&#34;&gt;Gamaga&lt;/a&gt;, I started with Operate Now: Hospital, a game published by &lt;a href=&#34;https://spilgames.com/&#34;&gt;Spil Games&lt;/a&gt; with more than 45M+ of installs. Operate Now is a hospital simulator, in the game you perform really realistic surgeries and follow a compelling storyline, while you also are in charge of running multiple hospitals, upgrading their departments, hiring and managing their staff and many other interesting mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was still in college this was my first experience profesionally as a game developer. Living in Caracas at the time I got contacted by a startup called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.learnsafari.com/&#34;&gt;LearnSafari&lt;/a&gt;, this happened in my last year of college, thanks to the game jams. Spanish Safari is a game or a tool for parents, with the purpose of teaching Spanish to kids in an interactive adventure game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
