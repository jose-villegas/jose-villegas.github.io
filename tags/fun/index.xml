      <description>&lt;p&gt;This game is more competitive we were a bit inspired by the Tron franchise visual style. I was already in Chile when making this game so I worked remotely with my friends in Caracas, Venezuela to complete this game. This game was really fun to play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this instance I was asked to create a game, alone, in a single week as part of a test. I ended up making an isometric platform game, you have to complete levels and collect coins along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time we really wanted to do a co-op game. We built the idea around a platform game where you play with your friend, you both co-perate together to advance in the map and defeat enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this game jam we went with a more spooky game. And we wanted to make it multi-player. So we came up with the idea to make a tag game but with some modifications to fit the theme and make it more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
