      <title>Deferred Voxel Shading for Real Time Global Illumination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my master thesis for Computer Graphics, eventually I managed to publish a paper for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing indirect illumination is a challenging and complex problem for real-time rendering in 3D applications. This global illumination approach computes indirect lighting in real time utilizing a simpliﬁed version of the outgoing radiance and the scene stored in voxels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first Global Game Jam, though I had experience before with game jams in college. It was a really great experience that ended up with me going for four years consecutively. The idea of making a complete game in just 48 hours was first daunting, but later awesome and completely achievable with good team work and focus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
