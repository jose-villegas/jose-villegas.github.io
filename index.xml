      <description>Hello there! My name is exactly as the site&amp;rsquo;s name, Jose Villegas. I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science graduate with a minor in computer graphics that has been working for years as game developer. I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Venezuela, Caracas, currently I live in Santiago, Chile. Game development was a natural path for me coming from computer graphics after college as both share many similarities and I really loved games and developing them, I was already making games before I even graduated.</description>

      <title>Deferred Voxel Shading for Real Time Global Illumination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my master thesis for Computer Graphics, eventually I managed to publish a paper for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing indirect illumination is a challenging and complex problem for real-time rendering in 3D applications. This global illumination approach computes indirect lighting in real time utilizing a simpliﬁed version of the outgoing radiance and the scene stored in voxels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Global Game Jam 2015 - Kidz Solution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first Global Game Jam, though I had been to game jams before in college. This was a really great experience that ended up with me going for four years consecutively. The idea of making a complete game in just 48 hours was first daunting, but later awesome and completely achievable with good team work and focus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this game jam we went with a more spooky game. And we wanted to make it multi-player. So we came up with the idea to make a tag game but with some modifications to fit the theme and make it more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
